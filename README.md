# UGAHACKsX - Bard Adventure

In order to play the game, download and run the BardAdventure.exe.

The controls for the game are:

Left arrow - Move left

Right arrow - Move right

Spacebar - Jump

Z - Melee attack

X - Ranged attack

The goal of the game is to kill as many slimes as possible before dying. The player starts with 5 lives and being touched by a slime will take a life.

There is a bug in which you may randomly lose lives in the bottom middle section of the map (around where you spawn). The root cause is unknown, but it may have to do with lingering hitboxes or invisible slimes. The best word of advice is to avoid that particular area of the map.
